# Capture the Flag for Informatics 310: Information Assurance and Cyber Security at the University of Washington

## Setup
+ Install Python 3.7 or greater
+ Update pip `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`(if this errors, do `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`)
+ Install tkinter if not already installed `pip3 install tkinter`(if this errors do `pip install tkinter`)
+ Open client and server settings.config and adjust based on needs
+ Run Server (python3 ./server/server.py) and Client (python3 ./client/start.py)

## Steps to Reproduce:
>! 1. Nmap to find the port
>! 2. Use the port to access the client
>! 3. Ping server with response that has hidden credentials.
>! 4. Sniff network to find unencrypted information
>! 5. Login to account
>! 6. Download encrypted message
>! 7. Decrypt the message
>! 8. Enter flag

## Easter Egg
>! 1. Find flag\_client file
>! 2. chmod into source code
>! 3. Find special flag
>! 4. Enter into flag

## Notes
* Technically a user could modify source code to get credentials without monitoring the network.
* The ping is actually a layer 2 TCP request instead of a layer 3 ICMP. The purpose is to add an unencrypted payload to the packets.
